/**
 * Where the build output goes, and why it is not always `.next`.
 *
 * `next dev` and `next build` write different things into the same directory, and a dev
 * server sharing `.next` with a production build leaves the two interleaved. The symptom
 * is not a clear error: it is `__webpack_modules__[moduleId] is not a function` thrown out
 * of `.next/server/pages/_document.js`, or a route that answers 404 because the manifest
 * on disk describes the other build. Both look like application bugs and are not.
 *
 * So anything that starts a server of its own — the browser check in tools/browser — sets
 * this to its own directory and stays out of the way of whatever the developer is running.
