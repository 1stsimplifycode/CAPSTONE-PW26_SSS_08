"""Thin execution adapters for the STATS modules.

Every function here is a **wrapper**, not an implementation. Each one imports canonical
code that already exists in ``research/`` or ``scripts/`` and calls it. No statistical
method, feature definition, model or evaluation metric is defined in this package, and
none may be: when a module needs science that does not exist yet, the manifest marks it
``INFRASTRUCTURE_ONLY`` and the adapter returns NOT YET EXECUTED instead of inventing a
substitute.

That rule is what keeps the restructuring reversible. Deleting this package and the
``STATS`` directory would leave the research pipeline exactly as it was.
