"""Shared loading and slicing for the live analysis adapters.

Two jobs, both of which exist so the analysis adapters can stay thin:

**Caching.** A live analysis runs on request, and re-reading a 300,000-row parquet on
every keystroke would make the interface feel broken for reasons that have nothing to do
with the research. Frames are read once per process and reused. They are never mutated:
every slicing helper returns a copy, because an adapter that filtered in place would
poison the cache for the next request.

**One filter.** Every adapter that takes a date range and an instrument list applies it
the same way, so two modules asked for the same slice see the same rows. A slice that is
too small to analyse is refused here rather than producing a confident number over eleven
observations.
