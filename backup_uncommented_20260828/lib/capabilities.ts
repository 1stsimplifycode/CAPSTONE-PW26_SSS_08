 * The product's capabilities and the week each one joins the demonstration.
 *
 * Read from `public/data/capabilities.json`, which `scripts/export_modules.py` writes from
 * the manifest's `product_capabilities:` block. The bundle carries no active week: which
 * of these are locked depends on the week a run is started at, and that is decided per
 * request. Keeping the two apart is what lets the pages stay statically prerendered while
 * the locks still change with `AEGIS_ACTIVE_WEEK`.
 *
 * Server-side only — it touches the filesystem. The navigation receives the result as a
 * prop rather than importing it, so no client bundle pulls `node:fs` in behind it.
